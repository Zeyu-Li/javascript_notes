# JavaScript Notes

Some notes on JavaScript, the language of the web! 

\*From now on I will shorten JavaScript to **js**

## General Info

* Stored in a .js file extension
* Runs in a event loop

## Uses

js runs on the browser but can also run natively with node.js. Node.js has a package manager called the node package manager or **npm** for short. With npm, there are a ton of packages that are quite powerful and different. For example, Electron.js is a desktop app creation tool that utilizes chromium at it's core.

### Popular Packages

Some of the most popular packages include:

* React - front end library that was developed by Facebook
* React Native - Based on react but works on Android and iOS, it is very fast as it transcodes into it's native language, ie Java for Android and Swift for iOS
* Express - a backend framework 
* Electron - a desktop app creation tool (not very space efficient)
* Socket.IO - library for developing with sockets (things that need to updated in real time)
* much much more...

## TypeScript

* TypeScript is a superset of js that adds static typing options
* It was designed to make js more strict. 
* TypeScript ultimately translates into js
